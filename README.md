### What I learned

oh boy where should start. As it obvious I took the liberty to change a bit the design just for the fun. But then I decided to create first an an in Javascript en then transform it into a React app and that is where the issues start because I have change gears from Vanilla to React and from Sass to ChakraUI and that was a challenge but the real pain was when I went crazy and decided to create my first RESTFful API, yes with a database hosted in Heroku that went nuts.Because it took me 2 days to fix an issue with the server deployment. At the end I resolved but after so much twicking I don't know what was wrong, I would say deleting the node_modules and installing them again fix the issue or having the right settings in the package.json file did the trick. I dont really care, now I can have finally have my Piña Colada 🍹to celebrate this victory 🎊🎉

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying responsive SCSS specially with Grid + Flexbox and CSS animation, transitions and FX like parallax.
